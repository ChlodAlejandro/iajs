WIP Internet Archive JavaScript and NodeJS client

NOTE: This is in an experimental phase and it will probably change a lot.

Planned features

- ✅ Read item metadata and list of files
- ✅ Search
- ✅ Search gifcities.org
- ✅ Query related item API
- Sign in
- Update item metadata and files
- Create items
- Query the Wayback Machine
- Add page to Wayback
- Get/set favorites
- Get/set reviews
- Read item display data (eg business logic from /details page)
- Generate embed codes for books/videos/music

Other TODO:

- ✅ Examples using non-compiled code straight in the browser. Eg unpkg

Note:
I wanted to build this while I worked at Internet Archive, but did not have the bandwidth
