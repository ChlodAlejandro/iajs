WIP Internet Archive JavaScript and NodeJS client

NOTE: This is in an experimental phase and it will probably change a lot.

Planned features
- Read item metadata and list of files
- Read item display data (eg business logic from /details page)
- Search
- Sign in
- Update item metadata and files
- Create items
- Add page to Wayback
- more tbd

Note:
I wanted to build this while I worked at Internet Archive, but did not have the bandwidth
